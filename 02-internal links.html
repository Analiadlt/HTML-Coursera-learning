    &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the
    man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
    or where the doer of deeds could have done them
    better. The credit belongs to the man who is
    actually in the arena, whose face is marred by
    dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
    who errs, who comes short again and again,
    because there is no effort without error and
    shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do
    the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
    devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;
    who at the best knows in the end the triumph of
    high achievement, and who at the worst, if he
    fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so
    that his place shall never be with those cold and
    timid souls who neither know victory nor
    defeat.&quot;
